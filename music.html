            <h6> My Music </h6>
            <p> My dad got me my first guitar in high school and I fell in love with writing songs. I've always loved writing poems my whole life so lyrics came naturally. I've written over a hundred songs on at least 12 cds between then and the time I was 30. Here are a few of my favorites. I never quite made it to be a superstar. Not all dreams come true. </p>

                <p class=""> I had a dream last night in my sleep<br>
                    It fed me everything i needed<br>
                    I am a river running far and in between<br>
                    But my mouth is the open ocean</p>

                    <p>Am i so desperate that i smell like rain?</p>

                    <p>He  handed me everything but i gave to back to him<br>
                    I  don't want an old man to watch life go by through a child's eyes<br>
                    But  i mean, who is he? and who am i?</p>

                    <p>  And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
                    High  class, depressed, and a closet druggie<br>
                    And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
                    A  model citizen of society</p>

                    <p>But  like you may feel a child's love<br>
                    I  want to take the earth and give it back<br>
                    I  want to cure everyone of everything<br>
                    Most  of all i want us all to be happy</p>

                    <p>You  think i dwell in this land of disease<br>
                    Like  a molecule will solve our problems<br>
                    Go  walk and talk and help society<br>
                    Don't  cry to me and don't lie to me<br>
                    Like god and hate and the threat of tv</p>

                    <p>  And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
                    High  class, depressed, and a closet druggie<br>
                    And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
                    A  model citizen of society</p>

                    <p>You  talk to me but my mind goes blank<br>
                    But  i am just a bit of everything<br>
                    Everything<br>
                    And  everything is just a part of me</p>

                    <p>Is  it my fault that i love the heat<br>
                    That  i like to fly and experience<br>
                    That  I'd run with the wolves if they'd let me<br>
                    Can I help it im guilty of everything</p>

                    <p>  And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
                    High  class, depressed, and a closet druggie<br>
                    And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
                    A  model citizen of society</p>

                    <p>I dismiss your feelings, I'm so selfish<br>
                    I want to be alone, I want to see my friends<br>
                    I want to see my friends<br>
                    Well I thought I deserved to be happy</p>

                    <p>Most  of all, I feel so crazy<br>
                    I draw swords with myself and we fight for eternity<br>
                    I just want back who I used to be<br>
                    I want timelessness and niavativity</p>

                    But I know you can handle it<br>
                    I’ve been pushing you down<br>
                    But I know you can get back up again <br><br>

                    And I’ve been foolin’ around<br>
                    ‘cause I know you’re not gonna find out<br>
                    And I’ve been crying alone<br>
                    That I'm never gonna feel this much again <br><br>

                    I know that you’re angry<br>
                    No, nothing ever makes sense<br>
                    I feel everything you’ve ever felt<br>
                    And I feel it more intense<br>
                    I know that you’re pacified<br>
                    The world’s brought you down<br>
                    Don’t take it out on me<br>
                    Don’t take it out <br><br>

                    Now it’s getting near dawn, and I'm still awake<br>
                    And I'm still getting drunk, and I'm still getting baked <br><br>

                    You tell me I'm wrong<br>
                    Make me feel so fucked up again<br>
                    My skin is crawling with bugs<br>
                    My world is spinning <br><br>

                    I know that you’re angry<br>
                    No, nothing ever makes sense<br>

                    Been lying all along<br>
                    I’m no longer at fault<br>
                    I am just skin and bone<br>
                    Nothing physical hurts <br><br>

                    My mind is made up of colors and fairy tales<br>
                    What about me has got you so pale<br>
                    I’ll let you take me to the stars<br>
                    If you can find out where they are <br><br>

                    I know that you’re angry<br>
                    No, nothing ever makes sense<br>

                    <p class="song-title"> Staying Awake </p>

                    <p> i'm lying here in a pile of leaves<br>
                    in the middle of the woods<br>
                    you can't take this from me<br>
                    i feel the exchange of so much energy<br>
                    different currents running through me<br><br>

                    so many trees and so many whispering voices<br>
                    i try to let them all pass by me<br>
                    but i take on the weight of the world<br>
                    and everyone else's troubles seem to find me<br><br>

                    i see it leaking through their eyes<br>
                    giving away the secrets in their minds<br>
                    the way a bloody soul gives sacrifice<br>
                    but it's just the tears of so many years of wasting away<br><br>

                    i don't want to give up today <br>
                    i don't want my body to lay <br>
                    i don't want to forget about yesterday <br>
                    i want to stay awake, i want to stay awake <br><br>

                    i'm lying here, drifting in the ocean <br>
                    all by myself, nothing on the horizon <br>
                    i like it here, my mind so open <br>
                    you can't take this from me, it's all from within <br><br>

                    you know, i met god, and he said to me <br>
                    all these silly arguments about religion <br>
                    when will the people see <br>
                    i am them and they are me <br><br>

                    i laughed and we shared a beer <br>
                    i feel so much calmer here <br>
                    when i drown the earth and disappear <br>
                    when i talk to him and let my thoughts appear <br><br>

                    i don't want to give up today <br>
                    i don't want my body to lay <br>
                    i don't want to forget about yesterday <br>
                    i want to stay awake, i want to stay awake <br><br>

                    it's raining now and i'm on my back <br>
                    i open my mouth as the sky turns black <br>
                    i scream, let it come pouring down <br>
                    let it come pouring down <br><br>

                    i've got to aquaint myself with your mood <br>
                    i start to feel anxious <br>
                    i make a drink <br>
                    you don't understand what i'm thinking <br>

                    how does this keep happening? <br><br>

                    every day i wake up, i turn to you <br>
                    but sometimes i swear <br>
                    i'm lying with a stranger <br>
                    i start to feel anxious <br>
                    i grab a beer <br>
                    i don't understand what's going on here <br>
                    you said you'd stay but you've disappeared <br>
                    how does this keep happening? <br><br>

                    every time i'm wasted, i turn to you <br>

                  your eyes they pierce me <br>
                  in a way I can't be touched <br>
                  because this world hasn't <br>
                    taught me how to love enough <br><br>
    
                  you're eyes they pierce me <br>
                  I've never loved anyone this much <br>
                  I've never fallen out of love <br><br>
    
                  another successful zombie <br>
                  ready to eat anything he can touch <br>
                  ready to love anything she fucks <br><br>
    
                  chorus <br>
                  just a glimpse of the dark <br>
                  in a child's broken heart <br>
                  what is worth this precious art <br>
                  what creates these beautiful scars <br>
                  what creates these beautiful scars <br>
                  these beautiful scars <br><br>
    
                  did you forget who you are <br>
                  did you mean to push me so far <br>
                  did you want to tear ourself apart <br>
                  did you mean to reopen this scar <br><br>
    
                  however you want me <br>
                  naked with or without my skin <br>
                  hungry with or without my sin <br><br>

                  i'm ready and willing to love <br>

                  that's more than i can say <br>
                  for most of humanity <br>
                  it's more than i can breathe <br>
                  it's farther than i can see <br><br>
    
                  i want you to take me <br>
                  i'm here and ready to run <br>
                  i'm ready to dissipate into <br>
                  the next dimension <br><br>
    
                  chorus <br><br>
    
                  did you hear what i said <br>
                  we are back from the undead <br>
                  i'm ready and willing to love <br>

                <p>  I know I am so tragic, but look at what you've done to me  <br>
                  you've taken everything, even the air that I breathe <br><br>
    
                  I dwell in this cave of darkness; you were the only light that I saw <br>
                  But I... No, I... I don't belong here; I can't do this anymore <br><br>
    
    
                  I feel my will caving in; Oh no, this can't be happening <br>
                  Don't bother sending your rescue ships unless you can save me from the ocean <br><br>
    
                  But I think I'd rather drown here, than have you drag me back to shore <br>
                  I'm not sure of anything anymore; why don't you tell me what you want!? <br><br>
    
    
                  I feel so exposed now; I'm going out of my mind <br>
                  I opened up, showed you everything; always knew I'd be the one left behind <br><br>
    
                  I watch you sail away; please don't leave me stranded <br>
                  I don't want to die out at sea; Throw me a lifeboat baby <br>
                  How many ways can I show I'm sorry </p>

                  Show me a dark lonely road to walk on <br>
                  I'll take this on alone <br>
                  Like I have since I was born <br>
                  I can move until all my bones are broken <br><br>
    
                  A trail through the trees <br>
                  She tricks me easily <br>
                  I'm torn up and scattered through all the leaves <br>
                  But after the rain <br>
                  When I can sense the spring <br>
                  I can feel my roots spreading <br><br>
    
                  I'm just a broken record <br>
                  I miss the thrill of the unknown <br>
                  I cry and she thinks I'm pathetic <br>
                  Can't ever seem to please her <br>
                  But whose house is she calling home <br><br>
    
                  I talk and my echo is the answer... <br><br>
    
                  Chorus <br>
                  I'm just a broken machine <br>
                  Too much conditioning <br>
                  Too many people beating me down, down <br>
                  So I'm a little worn out <br>
                  Too many crazies around <br>
                  I can't deal with anything <br><br>
    
                  My path turns to dust <br>
                  Sometimes it's just the two of us <br>
                  A strong wind comes and knocks me off my throne <br>
                  I wake in fog <br>
                  When it's barely dawn <br>
                  And I can't even remember who you are <br><br>
    
                  She gasps and can't catch her breath <br>
                  So sinister, so dramatic <br>
                  Somehow she lights her lips on fire <br>
                  I'm just a little sadistic <br>
                  But what does it matter <br>
                  As we live this lie we call life <br><br>
    
                  I talk and my echo is the answer... <br><br>

                <p> I exist here alone <br>
                In the middle of this snow storm <br>
                went to try my luck outside <br>
                just got water in my eyes <br>
    
                <p> inside i see shadows on the walls <br>
                dancing like they have eternity <br>
                and i wonder what it's like to fall <br>
                so far away from reality <br>
    
                <p> don't ask if you don't want to know <br>
                I'll keep my mouth closed <br>
                don't look if you don't want to see <br>
                this side of me <br>
    
                <p> why did you cry to me <br>
                when you knew that I was down <br>
                why did you lie to me <br>
                when you knew that I would still be there by your side <br>
                by your side
    
                <p> I exist here alone <br>
                in the middle of my home <br>
                I wonder what it's like to be <br>
                surrounded by family
    
                <p> would i be able to breathe <br>
                would they lighten up the dark i see <br>
                could they strip me from this earthly tomb <br>
                and let me, let me dance with infinity
    
                <p> when the snow melts and the smoke clears <br>
                maybe I'll come out of here <br>
                ecstasy in all my veins <br>
                now that I've escaped my internal winter <br>
                internal winter
    
                <p> I rest here alone <br>
                knowing there's strength in these old bones <br>
                finding out that i'm not alone <br>
                but so many others are scattered across the globe
    
                <p>like wildfire chasing our toes <br>
                like the haze inside your skull <br>
                don't leave me tonight, don't leave me alone <br>
                i want to make love in the early dawn <br>
                in the early dawn </p>

                well how do you feel now<br>
                everything you wanted is gone<br><br>

                Standing here waiting just to please you<br>
                I hear thru the walls all the words u say<br>
                Damn you for pushing, for keeping me away<br><br>

                You touch me, you scream at me, daggers in your words<br>
                You haven’t realized that I’ve stopped the hurt<br>
                Who are you to fucking criticize<br>
                Demons emerge through your shallow eyes<br><br>

                I’m touched am I'm hurt and I’m lost in time<br>
                I fade here next to you and we intertwine<br>
                But my path is deep and yours is getting narrow<br>
                My feet are already running away<br><br>

                oh girl, you save me but where do I find myself<br>
                Drowning and desperate to save myself<br>
                He pulls me up and out of the raging water<br>
                You watch from ashore and it doesn't matter<br><br>

                I am I am now larger than the sun<br>
                People tell me I’m not the only one<br>
                Hearts as big as the minds that create them<br>
                My ship is sinking in this lovely ocean<br><br>

                I am just a girl with a vivid dream<br>
                But it could mean, it could mean anything<br>
                Chances are it means nothing<br>
                But it could be, it could be everything<br><br>

                I’m a child but I’m growing old<br>
                I’m a lover but I’m getting bored<br>
                I am cheater and a liar but I forgive everyone for everything<br>
                Because otherwise what is love<br><br>

                Am I wrong, am I wrong in your eyes<br>
                Who am I to hold this self sacrifice<br>
                But if no one else than why can’t it be me<br>
                You are free to go and I am so willing<br>

                can't get it out of my mind<br>
                just need a little time alone to unwind<br>

                but all my truths turn into lies<br>
                before the words slip through my lips<br>
                they're broken apart in my mind<br><br>

                and now his soul rests in piece<br>
                how could this be?<br>
                what's really troubling me?<br>
                to think that i'm all alone<br>
                when they're all dead and gone<br>
                what happened to my immortality?<br><br>

                chorus<br><br>

                now don't you wonder where i went<br>
                that day i never came home<br>
                don't you wonder why my hands feel different<br>
                when they're touching your skin<br><br>

                now don't you wonder where i go<br>
                when i get that glossy look in my eyes<br>
                don't you wonder where i've been these past few months<br>
                well i don't know, i don't know<br>

                  I decide to take a walk tonight<br>
                  I say this is the end of me<br>
                  I go to a bridge I've known all my life<br>
                  Afraid of heights, I look down<br>
                  <br>
                  I've seen this once before<br>
                  I watched a movie last night<br>
                  The main character<br>
                  I can see through her eyes<br>
                  <br>
                  [ chorus ]<br>
                  You are the one that knocks me out cold<br>
                  I take a chance and I'm blown down<br>
                  I can't take this anymore, I've seen it all before<br>
                  I need to find a way to escape now<br>
                  <br><br>
                  I decide we don't need each other<br>
                  We can just blame ourselves<br>
                  I know this isn't the way you want it<br>
                  But I'm sick of dealing with the lies<br>
                  <br><br>
                  I used to have a gun<br>
                  But the bullets weren't enough<br>
                  The pills are gone<br>
                  And the bottle is empty<br>
                  My heart is black<br>
                  I need something to hold me back<br>
                  The ties are cut<br>
                  And I'm slipping in blood<br>
                  <br>
                  [ chorus ] <br>
                  <br>
                  In the distance I see your hand<br>
                  Reaching out for me, so tempting<br>
                  I know the only way to learn to fly is to fall<br>
                  Then I realize I don't trust you at all<br>
                  <br>
                  And it's then that I turn around<br>
                  I run into the dark<br>
                  And I am never going back<br>
                  No, I am never going back<br>
                  <br>
                  [ chorus ]<br>
                  <br>
                  You are the one that knocks me out cold but I'm gonna<br>
                  Take a chance but I'm blown down like always<br>
                  I can't seem to find my way back<br>
                  I can't find my way back home<br>
                  <br>
                  And I don't know where I'm going<br>
                  But I'm going to keep on running<br>
                  I'm not gonna stop for anything<br>
                  I'm gonna run 'til my shoes wear down<br>
                  Then I'll run 'til my feet are gone<br>
                  Then I'll run 'til I'm left with nothing<br>

                  slowly my memories fade to black<br>
                  covered up with sheets of sun<br>
                  and he lies there non-existant<br>
                  and i don't know him<br>
                  <br>
                  you'd think he'd tell me not to breathe<br>
                  that he's the stable one<br>
                  but tormented dreams erupt in fire<br>
                  and our passion melts the sun<br>
                  <br>
                  eventually... she disappears<br>
                  <br>
                  and his kind words offered no condolance<br>
                  i saw only the lies they hid<br>
                  subliminal messages whispered surrender<br>
                  i was stricken with fear and could no longer think<br>
                  <br>
                  my dreams were shot, sinking the sky<br>
                  i saw i was meant to die<br>
                  i screamed i was no longer worthy<br>
                  and innocent laughter flowed out his eyes<br>
                  <br>
                  eventually... she disappears<br>
                  eventually... she disappears<br>

                  I know it seems  I’m at a loss of words<br>
                  Believe me, it will only get worse<br>
                  I stare and my mind draws blanks<br>
                  I used to be so full of everything<br>
                  Faces in my carpet warp and twist when I sit still<br>
                  I’ve been told there are no faces here<br>
                  Reality is just an inconvenience<br>
                  I will see what I want<br>
                  <br>
                  Oh, I’m tripping again<br>
                  I can’t walk straight, my head is spinning<br>
                  Tell me how it got like this<br>
                  Do you think there’s something wrong?<br>

                  This is the future<br>
                  This is my life<br>
                  I’ve been too far gone to notice that i<br>
                  Have slowly been sinking deeper<br>
                  Into the floor<br>
                  How is it that I still want more?<br>
                  <br>
                  I feel as though there’s something missing<br>
                  Can you feel my breath on the back of your neck<br>
                  For so long I’ve been walking behind you<br>
                  How is it that you don’t turn to look<br>
                  Oh and now I’m floating<br>
                  I’ve become one with the air<br>
                  I think you’re in the next room<br>
                  But ask me if I really care<br>

                  Well tell me if you feel the same<br>
                  It really seems there’s something missing<br>
                  Like life is just one big game<br>
                  So who are the real players<br>
                  Was I made to win or doomed to lose<br>
                  And should I even really bother<br>
                  Or should I just try to feel good?<br>

                  Something told me that you had been here<br>
                  But I couldn’t quite remember<br>
                  <br>
                  I really need to work on this<br>
                  I’m pretty sure it’s not a good thing<br>
                  Another black out to add to the list<br>
                  And I don’t remember your name<br>
                  <br>
                  Another day gone<br>
                  Another black out<br>
                  What drug am I on this time?<br>
                  Give me another<br>
                  Another day to do the same old thing<br>
                  Another chance to drag this on<br>
                  How can I risk staying sober<br>
                  I don’t remember a thing<br>
    
                  That’s ok it’s just a phase<br>
                  It’s alright – it’s just another day<br>
                  It’s ok if you’re having fun he says<br>
                  So I take more and do it again<br>
                  <br>
                  My skin gets darker every day<br>
                  And each person I meet, I wear a different face<br>
                  You ask how many times can I play this game<br>
                  I just smile and say <br>
                  <br>
                  Another year gone<br>

                  There’s a man who walks on mountains<br>
                  There’s a man who flies in the sky<br>
                  There’s a man who carries his dreams on his back<br>
                  And I heard he never cries<br>

                  And here I am sitting in this quiet room<br>
                  Through which only my voice echos<br>
                  Now why can’t I be more like him<br>
                  I want the freedom<br>

                  I don’t think I will ever be<br>
                  Satisfied by this life<br>
    
                  Maybe if I run away I’ll find the mountains<br>
                  Get lost and learn to fly<br>
                  I don’t think my dreams will be that heavy<br>
                  Forget my age and never die<br>
                  <br>
                  Maybe one day I’ll grow tired of being h<br>ere
                  Wilt away, destroyed by fear<br>
                  Or maybe one day I will break free<br>
                  Join the world eternally<br>

                  I walked along this path of stone<br>
                  For so long I no longer know where I am<br>
                  And it dawned on me one day<br>
                  While I was feeling sick with worry<br>
                  <br>
                  That it doesn’t matter if I’m lost<br>
                  Because I’m never going back<br>
                  <br>
                  I look around, I see trees<br>
                  Sometimes I think they’re following me<br>
                  It freaks me out but it’s still better than<br>
                  Being in the middle of town getting stoned<br>
    
                  I still have no where to go	<br>

                  <br>
                  Voices in the wind tell me I’m still not free<br>
                  Should I follow this path or go back home?<br>
                  I don’t know where it’s taking me<br>
                  But there really isn’t much to leave<br>
                  <br>
                  I see a sunset on the horizon<br>
                  Fire dancing in the sky<br>
                  Why do we insist on destroying beauty?<br>
                  Make it seem unnatural to die?<br>
                  <br>
                  Am I out of touch, completely fucked?	<br>
                  I don’t like how I feel that much<br>
                  <br>
                  I lay down, my back to cold stone<br>
                  I relish in the fact that I’m alone<br>
                    That I’m alone<br>
                  I close my eyes, open my mind<br>
                  Spread my wings and let the wind take me<br>
                    To where it wants me to go<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sitting here, drinking tea<br>
                  Trying to find what makes me happy<br>
                  Playing guitar, feeling free<br>
                  Feeling you so close to me<br>
                  <br>
                  This song’s for you from my heart<br>
                  I don’t ever want to be apart<br>
                  Sew up your reopened scars<br>
                  <br>
                  I feel calm, like ecstasy<br>
                  Marijuana, LSD<br>
                  But all it is is your love for me<br>
                  Channels through my body<br>
                  <br>
                  This song’s for you, a happy one to sing along to<br>
                  For next time you’re feeling blue<br>
                  To remember that I’m here for you<br>
                  <br>
                  The sadness in my voice is now replaced<br>
                  With the sounds of rain<br>
                  In bed I lie with you so warm and perfect<br>
                  In my arms<br>
                  <br>
                  Are you happy, are you happy, are you happy with me<br>
                  I wrote this song for you, you make me complete<br>
                  <br>
                  Like the air I breathe I need you here<br>
                  Like the open sea I need you near<br>
                  Like the blood in my veins I need you, I need you<br>
                  Like the ground beneath my feet I need you<br>
                  <br>
                  Is it so hard for you to believe<br>
                  That you and I could ever be happy<br>
                  This song is for you, don’t you see?<br>
                  <br>
                  Every word I write, I think of you<br>
                  Every breath I breathe, I think of you<br>
                  Every song I sing, I think of you<br>
                  Everything I do, everything I do<br>
                  Every time I cry, you’re on my mind<br>
                  Every time I laugh with tears in my eyes<br>
                  Every time I’m happy you’re by my side<br>
                  Is this alright? Is this alright?<br>
                  <br>
                  I just want to be free, not bound by the laws of society<br>
                  I just want you there with me, is that so hard to believe?<br>
                  <br>
                  This song is for you<br>
                  This song is for you<br>
                  This song is for you<br>

                <p>
                  This world is full of things to hate<br>
                  I stay inside to try to forget<br>
                  I try to cover myself in sleep<br>
                  But I’m wide awake – I can’t help it!<br>
                  <br>
                  I try to find my way through the music<br>
                  I figure out where I am then I lose it<br>
                  I keep finding myself all over town<br>
                  Soon as I make my escape we’re going down down down<br>
                  <br>
                  Chorus<br>
                  I like it here better than anywhere else<br>
                  I feel safer…<br>
                  I’d rather stay here than live anywhere else<br>
                  That’s tainted with corruption<br>
                  <br>
                  Take a ride over here where everyone’s the same<br>
                  Open your eyes and join the dancing<br>
                  I feel the weight of everyone’s pain<br>
                  But it doesn’t stop me from dancing in the rain rain rain rain rain<br>
                  <br>
                  The music and the lights hold me down<br>
                  My breaths are shallow, head is spinning<br>
                  I see the music swirl ‘round<br>
                  The night is over – or is it just beginning?<br>
                  <br>
                  Chorus<br>

                <p>
                  Take a walk outside she said<br>
                  So I took her advice, I had nothing else to do that day<br>
                  I walked and walked until I couldn’t walk anymore<br>
                  The trail I was on had worn so thin I wasn’t sure which way it went<br>
                  But I had come this far and I wanted to see the end<br>
                  So I took a short break then continued walking<br>
                  And by now I knew it had been worth it, this hike to the end of the earth<br>
                  Now I know what’s coming and somehow that makes it easier<br>
                  <br>
                  What if I never saw how your eyes lit up your face in the dark<br>
                  Or how even with the smallest drop of moonlight, you’re animal comes out<br>
                  Sometimes all we really have is our basic instincts<br>
                  Otherwise I never would have made it to the end and back again<br>
                  <br>
                  About half way I came across an old rusty sword<br>
                  I used it to clear my path of enemies, I know you’d be proud<br>
                  Well look what I can do now<br>
                  Well look what I can do now<br>
                  <br>
                  I thought when I got back I might teach you, if you had any self control<br>
                  Maybe if I find a shield to keep out the coming blows<br>
                  My skin’s grown thick in places from the constant wind and dirt<br>
                  And I’ve learned how to leave no footprints in the places I have been<br>
                  <br>
                  What if the setting sun didn’t fill me with so much love for the world<br>
                  What if the smell of salt in the air didn’t clear the worries from my mind<br>
                  And the feel of the sun on my skin - how it makes me happy to be alive again<br>
                  How miserable it would be to hate everything<br>
                  <br>
                  Now that it’s gotten dark and I’m still not back, you’ve been worrying for hours<br>
                  And I catch glimpses of eyes watching me from the night<br>
                  If I was alone out here I’d be terrified<br>
                  But I’ve got my spirit and my pride<br>
                  Occasionally I hear silenced laughter and I see destruction up ahead<br>
                  I can only assume the firey rocks tell stories of the end<br>
                  By now I’m drenched in sweat, I strip down to just my skin<br>
                  Determined to go out of this world the way I came in<br>
                  <br>
                  Just then there was a flash of light<br>
                  I felt a blow to my head<br>
                  What if I don’t wake up in time<br>
                  I don’t want to be late again<br>
                  I enter the house weathered and worn<br>
                  You’re there by the door with tea in your hand<br>
                  You wrap me in a towel to stop the shivering<br>
                  And I tell you where I went<br>
                </p>

                  to find a way to relax<br>
                  a way to let you in
                  i find myself undressed<br>
                  and i give in to sin<br>
                  <br>
                  so what if these drugs that i take<br>
                  allow my brain to mend itself in a different way<br>
                  tell me, hey hey hey<br>
                  are you having fun today?<br>
                  <br>
                  bridge
                  so what if i'm easy; i feel it too baby<br>
                  come closer, inside me, and you can feel it like i do<br>
                  <br>
                  chorus<br>
                  in my head i hear the shoutings<br>
                  in my heart i feel the fear<br>
                  all the voices in the background<br>
                  what am i doing here?<br>
                  <br>
                  all this time you take from me<br>
                  and i still wonder why i can't breathe<br>
                  all these things i have to say<br>
                  i confide in you and you push me away<br>
                  <br>
                  i feel the calm creeping in<br>
                  so i like the way i feel...<br>
                  what's wrong with being like this<br>
                  where all inhibitions leave me...?<br>

                  bridge/chorus<br>
                  <br>
                  i didn't mean to get so lost<br>
                  here in the corners of my mind<br>
                  i only wanted to escape<br>
                  the pressures of living only to die<br>
                  <br>
                  and if this is how i open up to you<br>
                  and how you open up to me<br>
                  i'm sorry but i have to say<br>
                  i don't see what's wrong baby<br>
