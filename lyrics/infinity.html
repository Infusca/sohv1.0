<p> infinity (internal winter) </p>

<p> I exist here alone <br>
In the middle of this snow storm <br>
went to try my luck outside <br>
just got water in my eyes <br>

<p> inside i see shadows on the walls <br>
dancing like they have eternity <br>
and i wonder what it's like to fall <br>
so far away from reality <br>

<p> don't ask if you don't want to know <br>
I'll keep my mouth closed <br>
don't look if you don't want to see <br>
this side of me <br>

<p> why did you cry to me <br>
when you knew that I was down <br>
why did you lie to me <br>
when you knew that I would still be there by your side <br>
by your side

<p> I exist here alone <br>
in the middle of my home <br>
I wonder what it's like to be <br>
surrounded by family

<p> would i be able to breathe <br>
would they lighten up the dark i see <br>
could they strip me from this earthly tomb <br>
and let me, let me dance with infinity

<p> when the snow melts and the smoke clears <br>
maybe I'll come out of here <br>
ecstasy in all my veins <br>
now that I've escaped my internal winter <br>
internal winter

<p> I rest here alone <br>
knowing there's strength in these old bones <br>
finding out that i'm not alone <br>
but so many others are scattered across the globe

<p>like wildfire chasing our toes <br>
like the haze inside your skull <br>
don't leave me tonight, don't leave me alone <br>
i want to make love in the early dawn <br>
in the early dawn
