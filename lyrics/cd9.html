<p id="model-citizen"> <strong> Model Citizen </strong> </p>
<p>I had a dream last night in my sleep<br>
    Iit  fed me everything i needed<br>
    I  am a river running far and in between<br>
  But  my mouth is the open ocean</p>

  <p>Am  i so desperate that i smell like rain?</p>

  <p>He  handed me everything but i gave to back to him<br>
    I  don't want an old man to watch life go by through a child's eyes<br>
  But  i mean, who is he? and who am i?</p>

  <p>  And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
    High  class, depressed, and a closet druggie<br>
    And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
  A  model citizen of society</p>

  <p>But  like you may feel a child's love<br>
    I  want to take the earth and give it back<br>
  I  want to cure everyone of everything<br>
  Most  of all i want us all to be happy</p>

  <p>You  think i dwell in this land of disease<br>
    Like  a molecule will solve our problems<br>
    Go  walk and talk and help society<br>
  Don't  cry to me and don't lie to me<br>
  Like god and hate and the threat of tv</p>

    <p>  And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
    High  class, depressed, and a closet druggie<br>
    And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
  A  model citizen of society</p>

  <p>You  talk to me but my mind goes blank<br>
    But  i am just a bit of everything<br>
    Everything<br>
    And  everything is just a part of me</p>

  <p>Is  it my fault that i love the heat<br>
    That  i like to fly and experience<br>
    That  I'd run with the wolves if they'd let me<br>
  Can I help it im guilty of everything</p>

    <p>  And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
    High  class, depressed, and a closet druggie<br>
    And  isn't everybody just like me<br>
  A  model citizen of society</p>

  <p>I dismiss your feelings, I'm so selfish<br>
    I want to be alone, I want to see my friends<br>
    I want to see my friends<br>
    Well I thought I deserved to be happy</p>

  <p>Most  of all, I feel so crazy<br>
    I draw swords with myself and we fight for eternity<br>
    I just want back who I used to be<br>
    I want timelessness and niavativity</p>

<p id="queen"><strong>Queen</strong>
<p>If  I'm king then you&rsquo;re my queen<br>
I&rsquo;ll  give you anything<br>
Just  be there to support me<br>
And  love me despite everything</p>
<p>Because  I give you everything you need<br>
And  you take it so selfishly<br>
My  little spoiled queen<br>
You  don&rsquo;t get anything for free</p>
<p>The  way you&rsquo;re downing your drinks<br>
I  see you&rsquo;re taking after me<br>
Well  can&rsquo;t you find your own way<br>
To  your self-destruction</p>

<p id="foolin"> <strong> Foolin’ Around </strong> </p>

<p> I’ve been messing around<br>
But I know you can handle it<br>
I’ve been pushing you down<br>
But I know you can get back up again <br><br>

And I’ve been foolin’ around<br>
‘cause I know you’re not gonna find out<br>
And I’ve been crying alone<br>
That I'm never gonna feel this much again <br><br>

I know that you’re angry<br>
No, nothing ever makes sense<br>
I feel everything you’ve ever felt<br>
And I feel it more intense<br>
I know that you’re pacified<br>
The world’s brought you down<br>
Don’t take it out on me<br>
Don’t take it out <br><br>

Now it’s getting near dawn, and I'm still awake<br>
And I'm still getting drunk, and I'm still getting baked <br><br>

You tell me I'm wrong<br>
Make me feel so fucked up again<br>
My skin is crawling with bugs<br>
My world is spinning <br><br>

I know that you’re angry<br>
No, nothing ever makes sense<br>
I feel everything you’ve ever felt<br>
And I feel it more intense<br>
I know that you’re pacified<br>
The world’s brought you down<br>
Don’t take it out on me<br>
Don’t take it out <br><br>

Been lying all along<br>
I’m no longer at fault<br>
I am just skin and bone<br>
Nothing physical hurts <br><br>

My mind is made up of colors and fairy tales<br>
What about me has got you so pale<br>
I’ll let you take me to the stars<br>
If you can find out where they are <br><br>

I know that you’re angry<br>
No, nothing ever makes sense<br>
I feel everything you’ve ever felt<br>
And I feel it more intense<br>
I know that you’re pacified<br>
The world’s brought you down<br>
Don’t take it out on me<br>
Don’t take it out<br> </p>

<p id="staying-awake"> <strong> Staying Awake </strong> </p>

<p> i'm lying here in a pile of leaves<br>
in the middle of the woods<br>
you can't take this from me<br>
i feel the exchange of so much energy<br>
different currents running through me<br><br>

so many trees and so many whispering voices<br>
i try to let them all pass by me<br>
but i take on the weight of the world<br>
and everyone else's troubles seem to find me<br><br>

i see it leaking through their eyes<br>
giving away the secrets in their minds<br>
the way a bloody soul gives sacrifice<br>
but it's just the tears of so many years of wasting away<br><br>

i don't want to give up today <br>
i don't want my body to lay <br>
i don't want to forget about yesterday <br>
i want to stay awake, i want to stay awake <br><br>

i'm lying here, drifting in the ocean <br>
all by myself, nothing on the horizon <br>
i like it here, my mind so open <br>
you can't take this from me, it's all from within <br><br>

you know, i met god, and he said to me <br>
all these silly arguments about religion <br>
when will the people see <br>
i am them and they are me <br><br>

i laughed and we shared a beer <br>
i feel so much calmer here <br>
when i drown the earth and disappear <br>
when i talk to him and let my thoughts appear <br><br>

i don't want to give up today <br>
i don't want my body to lay <br>
i don't want to forget about yesterday <br>
i want to stay awake, i want to stay awake <br><br>

it's raining now and i'm on my back <br>
i open my mouth as the sky turns black <br>
i scream, let it come pouring down <br>
let it come pouring down <br><br> </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p id="every-time"><strong> Every Time </strong></p>

<p>  <br>all this time i've been running <br>
away from you <br>
all this time you've been chasing <br>
me, and now i'm through <br>
every day i wake up, i turn to you <br>
i've got to aquaint myself with your mood <br>
i start to feel anxious <br>
i make a drink <br>
you don't understand what i'm thinking <br>
did i, did i fuck up again? <br>
how does this keep happening? <br><br>

every time i'm wasted, i turn to you <br>
every time i fall, you pull me through <br>
every time i hallucinate, i see you <br>
every time i fall, you pull me through <br><br>

all this time i've been hiding <br>
inside my mind <br>
all this time you've been searching <br>
but you're running blind <br>
every day i wake up, i turn to you <br>
but sometimes i swear <br>
i'm lying with a stranger <br>
i start to feel anxious <br>
i grab a beer <br>
i don't understand what's going on here <br>
you said you'd stay but you've disappeared <br>
how does this keep happening? <br><br>

every time i'm wasted, i turn to you <br>
every time i fall, you pull me through <br>
every time i hallucinate, i see you <br>
every time i fall, you pull me through <br><br>

every time i'm wasted, i turn to you <br>
every time i fall, you pull me through <br>
every time i hallucinate, i see you <br>
every time i fall, you pull me through <br><br>
