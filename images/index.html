              <div>
                <p> Almost finished updating all the pages' to the new layout. Will be finished by the end of today. Then will add more content [ metal detecting gallery and music page ]. Once all that is done, I will try to figure out why my Wood Turning website is down and fix that; and then the next step will be to create a webpage for my HOT SAUCE! </p>
                <p> Woke up early today, so I'm doing one of my favorite things... having a coffee and working on my website in the quiet dark hours of the morning, alone. One of the benefits of this is that Relic comes down to see me in my room, where he feels safer and actually comes up to me to be pet. Meows at me for attention. I can pet him all I want as long as I don't move from my chair. I made the mistake of trying to pick him up though and he struggled and struggled until he broke free and now he's gone. Woops. Scaredy cat. Oh well, maybe one day. He does love me though; I'm second in line after Willow. When I get home from work at night, he comes out of his hiding place upstairs on the loft and peeks down and starts screaming at me. He won't come say hi, but I know he's happy I'm home because he would be hiding all day and just come out because he hears my voice. <3 </p>

            <h6> No More Saving Time <span style="font-size: 8px; text-align: right">. 03/16/22</span></h6>
              <div>
                <p> Check out the new layout. I know. Can't stop, won't stop. Maybe this one will stick a while. I'm still in the process of updating all the pages and adding content. I'm off this coming weekend so I plan on "finishing" up the project by then. So be sure to check back next week! :D</p>
                <p> I've so far updated these pages to the new layout: home page, music page, metal-detecting page. The others will likely be done later today, but first I have to go enjoy the outdoors because it's beautiful out, and go metal detecting. I will update this post later with a picture of the copper I found.</p>
                <p> In other news, I heard that daylight saving's may be finally fading into the past. Let's hope. It's kind of embarrassing. </p>

            <h6> Covid <span style="font-size: 8px; text-align: right">. 11/24/21</span></h6>
              <div>
                <p> Well, for the second year in a row I won't be seeing my family for Thanksgiving. I recently tested positive for covid. I had been notified, a couple weeks ago, that someone I worked with had tested positive. This was on my weekend off and when I returned to work I tested myself to be safe and tested negative. That was 6 days after exposure. Around this same time I started getting a sore throat. However, since I had just tested negative the day before, I figured it was just a regular cold if anything. It wasn't until almost another week I tested again and came out positive. Then it hit full force with sinus pressure, headache, runny nose, sore throat, and loss of smell.

            <div>
              <p> Whoohoo! Website officially updated. I will continue to update and make a new post every Friday morning, so stay tuned. </p>

              <div><img src="images/fossil3.jpg" style="float:right;"><img src="images/fossil1.jpg" style="float:left;">
              <p> Today is normally my day off but I am going in to work later today to cover a shift. In return I will get tomorrow off instead. This means I can join Stef and the crew metal detecting. I can't wait to find some treasure! I have a good feeling. Stay posted to see what I find! </p>
              <p> Update on my little Meatball: Relic had a follow up vet appt yesterday. He is doing ok. Still sneezing, still hiding, still running away, but when you catch him he is such a cutie. So cuddley and loving. Now that he's traumatized from being captured and taken to the vet though, I've barely seen him in the last 24 hours. He'll probably never trust me again. </p>
              <p> Yesterday I made kitty treats from a recipe I got from PrettyLitter.com. Not sure my cats love them as much as I'd hoped, so worse case... well, dogs eat anything. I ate a couple myself. Not bad. Kind of tasteless if you ask me. </p>
              I also made banana bread. Pretty yum. Threw in some dark chocolate chips, coconut, and cashews. Yum. </p>

              <p> Here's the real highlight of my week. A month or so ago I went to DigStock in Chazy, NY. It was a large metal detecting event with hundreds of acres of fields to detect. As usual, while detecting, I couldn't help but pick up some rocks along the way. I found one that looked like it had a little fossil. Possibly a plant, I thought. Well just this past week I finally cleaned off all the dirt from it and found not one, but TWO more similar fossils on it as well! Now they looked like little shells. Clam shells or similar. I did a little research and determined them to be dunbarella. This is a type of clam or related creature that lived 300 million years ago! (For reference dinosaurs lived 65 - 248 million years ago.) This definitely checked one of the bucketlist for me. I've always loved rocks and fossils and now I've finally found my own! I have got to say, it still blows my mind that dinosaurs existed. If there was ever a time period that I would time travel to. God damn. I don't even care if I get killed, eaten, or stomped on immediately. </p>

            <div>
              <p> Operation Redesign Overhaul: complete. Welcome once again to my newly redesigned webpage. It's all I seem to do - revamp the layout everytime I finish and get bored and disappointed with the previous one. Hopefully this one is here to stay so I can focus on content instead. Most of the pages are up to date however there are still some works in progress. <p>
              <p> I will be uploading more of my own music/lyrics. The photography section is still a work in progress, as usual. I still need to devote some time to diving a little deeper into that subject. Eventually I will also be adding a drone section as well. I have a Mavic Mini but he's currently under the weather and due for repairs. </span> </p>

            <h6> New Kitten <span style="font-size: 8px; text-align: right">. 11/14/21</span></h6>
            <div>
              <p> <img src="images/relic-artcl1.jpg"> First of all - welcome to my new website. Once again I've redesigned it, aiming for a simple, clean design. CHECK. Thank you for coming and thank you for staying. <br><br>
               Secondly, we have a new addition to the household. He's small. He's cute. He's my little Meatball. His name is Relic and he's adorable!</p>
               <p> Relic's backstory: He was born into a feral cat colony that lives in a junkyard in Norwich, CT, that is maintained by a wonderful woman named Leslie. Leslie watches over a couple colonies: feeding them, capturing and vaccinating them, neutering; and inevitably kittens are always being born so she will capture the kittens to find them safe homes. Relic was one of these kittens.</p>
               <p> About Relic: He has very large dark pupils that don't respond to light. His tail is bent, most likely broken when he was a tiny thing. Sad, but it doesn't hurt him now. He has stinky breath and discoloured teeth which the vet said should resolve when his adult teeth grow in (hopefully!). He loves to romp and play with Willow (our 1 yo kitten we got last Fall). He has a scratchy little meow and although he's really skittish and runs away all the time he also will come to you when he really wants attention and sit at your feet screaming lol. He's TOO CUTE. </p>
